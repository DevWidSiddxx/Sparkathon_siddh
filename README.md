# SuperMart - Warehouse to Rack Inventory System  
**Team Mutables | Walmart Sparkathon 2025 | Transforming retail supply chains**

## Overview  
** TOPIC :- Transforming Retail Supply Chains**
SuperMart is a smart warehouse-to-rack inventory management system that digitally manages how items are restocked in a retail environment. Designed as a scalable and future-ready solution, it enables employees to transfer items from the warehouse to store racks using a simple and intuitive interface — logging item, quantity, location, and employee ID in real-time.

This solution lays the **foundation for our key innovation** — **QR-integrated shelf monitoring**. In the upcoming phase, racks will be embedded with QR codes that, when scanned, dynamically display the live stock status. This eliminates manual shelf-checking, minimizes out-of-stock incidents, and empowers associates to make faster, smarter replenishment decisions.

## Key Features

- **Digital Restocking Interface**  
  Employees can digitally log item transfers, improving transparency and reducing manual errors.

- **Live Rack Status Dashboard**  
  Rack inventory is updated instantly with quantities, item details, and category-specific rack zones.

- **Recent Activity Timeline**  
  Tracks all restocking operations with timestamps and employee tracking.

- **Local Storage Simulation**  
  Uses browser-based storage to simulate backend interaction, enabling a lightweight prototype for instant testing.

## Vision: QR-Based Shelf Intelligence  
At the core of this project is a **vision to make every retail rack intelligent**. Through **QR integration**, store associates and managers will be able to:

- Instantly check stock levels by scanning shelf QR codes using mobile or handheld devices.
- Get real-time alerts for low-stock or out-of-stock items.
- Automate inventory audits with a single scan.

This not only **reduces operational friction** but also **enhances customer satisfaction** by ensuring consistent product availability.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Custom Grid), JavaScript
- **Storage**: Browser LocalStorage (to simulate rack and activity data)
- **Backend**: REST API (Node.js + Express), MongoDB, Authentication, QR Code Service Integration
- **Generative AI(Planned)**: RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation), MCP (Model context protocol)  enable intelligent assistant responses.  
  This will allow store staff to query stock trends, restock recommendations, and get contextual answers from inventory history.
